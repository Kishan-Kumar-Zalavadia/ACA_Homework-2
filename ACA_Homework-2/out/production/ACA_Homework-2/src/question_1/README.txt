To execute the code with 10 random inputs, simply run the `Main.java` class.

If you need a different number of random inputs, you can modify the value of the 'random' variable on line 128.

If you prefer to provide custom input, you can do so by commenting out the code from lines 126 to 142 and uncommenting the code from line 103 to 124.
