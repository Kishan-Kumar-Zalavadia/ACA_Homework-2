To execute the code with Given inputs, simply run the `Main.java` class.

To execute the code on 10 random inputs, you need to comment out code from line 103 to 129 and uncomment code from lines 131 to 147.
If you need a different number of random inputs, you can modify the value of the 'random' variable on line 128.

If you prefer to provide custom input, you can do so by commenting out the code from lines 131 to 147 and uncommenting the code from line 103 to 129.
